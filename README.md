IronScales Automation Exam

Hello and welcome!

There are 4 test cases classes in this app:
1) NavigationBarTest - Validates “starter“, “email protect”, and ”complete protect“.
2) CareersTest - Validates that year of experience is bigger than 1y.
3) SocialMediaTest - Validates the type and functionality of the social media buttons.
4) RemovalTest - A suite of tests to verify the correctness of the “remove” method.

Before each step in the GUI tests the code will take a screenshot.
Screenshots will be stored in the Screenshots folder.
Incase of a failure, the code will also take a screenshot.

After the tests are done, the code will generate a report with the results.
The Extent Report is located in the test-output folder, under myReport.html.

Please notice that this is a Maven project & TestNG Framework,
All the dependencies can be found at pom.xml.

Thank you!
